# Single fire pulse

I needed a re-usable circuit that can be used to generate (based off a
manual push button) a specified length high pulse, regardless of how
long the push button is held down.

I use this for manual testing of anything that needs a single fire
pulse (d-latches etc).

The schema is in Kicad format, with a ![PDF](singlefire.pdf) version
available as well
